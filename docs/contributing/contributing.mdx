## Contribution guidelines

### How to contribute to nmrXiv

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in nmrXiv**, and instead contact us [here](mailto:info@nmrxiv.org).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to nmrXiv](/docs/contributing) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Do not open an issue on GitHub or suggest your change in the [nmrXiv mailing list](https://nnmrXiv.org) before you start coding.
