This website is based on the [Docusaurus framework](https://docusaurus.io) that uses [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) with [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) [(MDX)](https://mdxjs.com/). Therefore, the content is stored as a mixture mainly containing [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) with elements from [HTML](https://html.com/) and from the [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) framework [React](https://reactjs.org/). The most important and used components are explained below. More information about [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) in docusaurus can be found in the [official Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features).

# Contributing to nmrXiv documentation
## How to
### Editing
In order to edit the documentation, you need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Then, you can use the ```Edit this page``` button at the left bottom of every page. This will lead you to an [Editor on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/managing-files-on-github/editing-files-in-your-repository) in the `development` branch, where you can directly edit the page. When you are satisfied with the changes you have made, `Commit changes`. You can check the [Actions](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/nmrxiv-docs/actions) to see if the workflow run has completed successfully, and then make a `pull request`. The project admins review the requests regularly and merge the approved ones. After merging `development` branch with the `main` branch, changes will be directly deployed and gone online. To ensure consistent style and naming throughout the documentation, please refer to our [Conventions](#conventions)

### Adding a New Page
* Go to the chosen directory on [GitHub](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/nmrxiv-docs/tree/development/docs).
* Click `Add file`, and choose <b>Create new file</b>.
* <b>Name your file</b> in the corresponding field, and give it the extension ".mdx".
* Insert at the top of the file, e.g.:

```bash
---
sidebar_position: 2
id: contributing-to-nmrxiv-docs.mdx
title: Contributing to nmrxiv Docs.mdx
---
```
| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|
| sidebar_position | Number | Default ordering | Controls the position of a doc inside the generated sidebar slice when using autogenerated sidebar items. See also [Autogenerated sidebar metadatas](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar#autogenerated-sidebar-metadatas).|
| id | String | File path (including folders, without the extension) | A unique document id.|
| title | String | Markdown title or id | The text title of your document. Used for the page metadata and as a fallback value in multiple places (sidebar, next/previous buttons...). Automatically added at the top of your doc if it does not contain any Markdown title. |

More fields and the <b>Description</b> of each field can be found in [docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs). 

After you have inserted a new page, add its <b>id</b> from the metadata section at the top of the file to the [sidebars.js](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/nmrxiv-docs/blob/development/sidebars.js) file, so that it is added to the TOC (table of contents) on the left of every documentation page, and it becomes visible on the page.

### Headings
To create a heading, add one or more # signs in front of the word or phrase. The number of # you use should correspond to the heading level. A lot of # indicates a low level.

### Escaping Signs
To show signs that are specified in the Markdown syntax, escape them with "\".

### Links
Links can be added via [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/):

In Markdown:
```md
[Text to be shown on the page](actual link)
```
In React:
```js
import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

<Link to="/path">Title</Link>
```
### Lists
#### Ordered List
Enter the number that you want your list to start with, enter a dot and a space, then enter your text. When you hit enter, the next number will be generated automatically.
```
2. First line.
3. Second line.
4. Third line.
```
Output:

2. First line.
3. Second line.
4. Third line.

Please not, if you enter random numbers with dots, the generated list will still be ordered based on the first number!!
```
2. First line.
5. Second line.
2. Third line.
```

Output:

2. First line.
5. Second line.
2. Third line.


#### Unordered Lists:
Use either * or - at the beginning of the line, then enter a space and then your text.
```
* First line.
- Second line.
```

Output:
* First line.
- Second line.


### Code Blocks
Code blocks enable highliting your code and its syntax based on the language. To use code blocks:
1. Wrap your code with 3 backticks.
2. Add the right language.
3. Insert your code.
4. Optionally, you can add title or highlight certain lines in the code. For more details, please refer to [Docusaurus Code blocks](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks).

For instance: 

\```js

<span style={{color:"yellow"}}>Example</span>

\```

Which will look like: 

```js
<span style={{color:"yellow"}}>Example</span>
```

For a list of the supported languages, please visit the [link](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/vendor/prism/includeLangs.js). It is common to use "bash", "html", "js", and "md" in this documentation. Please also use "Bash" code blocks for errors too.

### Images/gifs

Images/gifs can be inserted as [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), or as [HTML](https://html.com/) for special configurations (optional "width" and "height" etc.) or if the image is inside an [HTML tag](https://html.com/#What_are_Tags_and_Attributes).
The `![...]` in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or `alt={...}` in [HTML](https://html.com/)/[React](https://reactjs.org/) creates an `alt` tag for an additional title, if the image loading fails.
Keep in mind, that the image/gif paths for [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and [HTML](https://html.com/) differ due to different treatment of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)  and [React](https://reactjs.org/) (which creates the [HTML](https://html.com/)) in [Docusaurus framework](https://docusaurus.io).

Inserting an image/gif  with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/):

``` md
![Docusaurus Logo](/img/docusaurus.png)
```

Inserting an image/gif  with [HTML](https://html.com/) ([React](https://reactjs.org/)):
``` js
<img src={require('@site/static/img/docusaurus.png').default} width={"30px"} height={"30px"} alt={"Docusaurus Logo"} />
```

#### SVG
SVGs need a special treatment. First import them as [React component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html), and then insert them in your text with `className="logo"`:

``` js
import Sun from '@site/static/img/sun.svg'
<Sun title="Sun" className="logo" width={"30px"} height={"30px"} />
```
### Tables
```
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|---|---|
| Field 1  |  Field 2 |
```
Output:
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|---|---|
| Field 1  |  Field 2 |

### Info Boxes
Highlighted info boxes with further informations are called "Admonitions" in [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions). There are 3 possibble admonitions in nmrXiv Docs:

:::danger Caution
Caution: When there is risk of losing data, breaking things down, and so on..
:::

:::caution Recommendation
Recommendation: When a certain behaviour is recommended, but not necessary.
:::

:::info Info
Info: Any important piece of information to be highlighted.
:::

### Inserting Downloadable Files
If you want to provide one or multiple file(s) to be downloaded directly form the documentation, upload them to the [files folder in GitHub](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/nmrxiv-docs/tree/development/static/files), and insert a Download Button with the filepath(s) - separated by comma - in `files` and the text to be shown on the button in `text`:

```
import { DownloadBtn } from '@site/docs/download-files.js'

<DownloadBtn files={['/nmrxiv-docs/static/files/test-file.txt']}  text={"Download test file here"}/>
```

### Formatting

#### Bold

```
<b>Example</b>
```
Output:
<b>Example</b>

#### Italics
```
<i>Example</i>
```
Output:
<i>Example</i>

#### Highlighted Elements

```
`Example`
```
Output:
`Example`

#### Line Breaks
Add two blank lines (two "enter"s) where the line break is intended to be.

#### Color
* Colored letters:
```js
<span style={{color:"yellow"}}>Example</span>
```
Output:
<span style={{color:"yellow"}}>Example</span>

* Colored background:
```js
<span style={{background:"yellow"}}>Example</span>
```

Output:
<span style={{background:"yellow"}}>Example</span>

#### Strikethrough
```html
<del>Example</del>
```
Output:
<del>Example</del>


## Conventions

### Hyperlinks
We would recommend the intensive use of hyperlinks instead of plain text whenever possible. The intro of this page is a good example for that. 

### Bold Text
All terms in this documentation that are bolded can also be found within the user/developer interface. 

### Tables
To maintain a consistent view throught the table, the first letter from the first word will always be capitalized (unless it is a unit). Full stops will be used when the correct langiage requires them. The following table provides more details and examples.

| Case | Capitalization | Full stop | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | to be written as provided by [The International System of Units (SI)](https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units) | No | "Hz", "Â°C", "cm" |
| Single word| Only first letter, unless the word is usually written differently| No | "No", "True", "NMR" |
| Phrase | Only first letter from the first word, unless other words require so | No | "NMR technique", "Chemical formula" |
| Sentence | To be written according to the correct use of langauge| Yes | "Fields with description are usually provided as sentences which requires adding a full stop at the end of the sentence." |

### Capitalization
Please always capitalize:
* The first letter of the first word, unless it is officially written with small letters, e.g., "nmrXiv".
* Headings: The first letter of each word except articles, conjunctions, and prepositions that have less than four letters. e.g., "Contributing to nmrXiv Docs".

Please note: Prepositions are dealt with as a normal word and are capitalized when applicable in the following cases:
* If they are part of the verb: "Starting Up the Application".
* If they have more than 4 letters: "Further Steps After Installation".

### Highlighting Elements
[Highlighted Elements](https://docs.nmrxiv.org/docs/contributing/contributing-to-nmrxiv-docs/#highlighted-elements) should be used with files and folders names, and to highlight words where bolding is not applicable.

### Images
Images are to be added directly after the corresponding paragraph.
