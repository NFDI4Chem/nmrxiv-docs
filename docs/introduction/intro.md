**nmrXiv** (pronounced `nm-archive`) is a FAIR and Open, Consensus-Driven Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Data Repository and Computational platform. It is currently being developed as a part of NFDI4Chem with the ultimate goal of accelerating broader coordination and data sharing among researchers by creating a platform for managing, sharing, and analysing raw and processed NMR spectral data.

This documentation site comprises detailed walk-through explanations from basic to more complex functionalities for developers (Developer Guides), submitters (Submission Guides) and users (Search and API) of **nmrXiv**. This documentation-first approach allows developers and users to discuss proposed features and ensure that the implementations reflect the actual use cases. All the adopted core concepts, such as data schemas, file formats, tools & converters, ontologies, FAIR best practices, etc., are documented to ensure a clear scaffolding for developers to revisit previously developed parts and continue building upon them.

The immediate goal of **nmrXiv** is to integrate and execute the following objectives by establishing **nmrXiv** as the new highly visible and consensus-driven resource designed to serve global research and adjacent communities.

### Software development
To develop a voluntarily FAIR, cloud-based infrastructure that uses freely shared source code and deployment methods. Apply industry-grade development practices to ensure platform reliability, safety, and efficacy. Use Continuous Improvement principles will ensure an always-on user experience and high reliability. Release the codebase and infrastructure details (including the development, documentation and usage practices) through MIT Open Source License for openness.

### Submission, Curation and Analysis

Enable the FAIR Sharing of raw NMR data to enhance the quality of chemical research and dissemination. Also, to develop non-prescriptivist curation and analysis standards by nature for data and metadata. Built standards with input and contributions from the community and made them compatible with existing and potential newly developed formats and approaches.

### Training
To engage analytical chemistry researchers and adjacent communities through webinars, workshops, tutorials, and community calls to ensure that **nmrXiv** meets the researchersâ€™ needs and implements adequate incentive mechanisms for data contributions and curation.

:::note
**Why another NMR Repository??** <br/>
Over the past few decades, several repositories have been developed to host literature-derived and experimental NMR data; however, these repositories do not meet the needs of all chemical communities (also natural products & metabolomics) in several ways. This includes a lack of experimental data, limited search capabilities, and more importantly, they are not FAIR compliant.

**nmrXiv** will be the **first FAIR and Open archive to preserve NMR data in its original instrument format** and will promote **Open Data and Open Standards** to maximise long term sustainability of the resource and FAIRness of the archived data.
