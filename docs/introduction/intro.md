nmrXiv is an open cloud-based repository that hosts raw and processed NMR data, providing support for submission, browsing, searching, analyzing and disseminating data worldwide. 

This documentation site is composed of detailed walk-through explanations for basic and more complex functionalities for both nmrXiv developers (Developer Guides) and users (Submission Guides). With our documentation-first approach we would like to allow nmrXiv developers and users to discuss proposed features and ensure that the implementations reflect the real use cases.

We document all the adopted core concepts from data schemas, file formats, tools & converters, ontologies and FAIR best practices etc. here to ensure a clear scaffolding for developers to revisit previously developed parts and continue building upon them.

nmrXiv architecture, deployment, and development practices are also documented here to ensure the core development and deployment principles are conveyed from the project's inception.
