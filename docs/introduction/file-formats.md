# File formats

nmrXiv will promote Open Data and Open Standards to maximize the long-term sustainability of the resource and FAIRness of the archived data. To reduce user burden and foster immediate utility, nmrXiv will accept raw NMR data in all original instrument formats. 

Upon upload, the platform will convert all data to available Open data formats, such as JCAMP-DX, NMReData, nmrML. The type of information stored in existing formats is heterogeneous, and no single format is currently capable of fully capturing all information from NMR experiments and data processing. NMReData (co-developed by nmrXiv team members) is the most promising Open format as it supports all data types, except for raw spectral data. 

As native instrument formats represent the most available data, they will be preserved and made available to users. This approach ensures traceability and secure, long-term access to every detail of measured data as new formats appear or existing ones evolve. At the same time, the availability and interoperability of several formats will facilitate the re-use of data with external tools.
