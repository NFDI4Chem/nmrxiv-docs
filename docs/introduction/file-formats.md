# File formats

nmrXiv will promote Open Data and Open Standards to maximize the long-term sustainability of the resource and FAIRness of the archived data. To reduce user burden and foster immediate utility, nmrXiv will accept raw NMR data in all original instrument formats. 

Upon upload, the platform will convert all data to available Open data formats, such as JCAMP-DX, NMReData, and nmrML. The type of information stored in existing formats is heterogeneous, and no single format is currently capable of fully capturing all information from NMR experiments and data processing. NMReData (co-developed by nmrXiv team members) is the most promising Open format as it supports all data types, except for raw spectral data. 

As native instrument formats represent the most available data, they will be preserved and made available to users. This approach ensures traceability and secure, long-term access to every detail of measured data as new formats appear or existing ones evolve. At the same time, the availability and interoperability of several formats will facilitate the re-use of data with external tools. 

## Overview on available NMR file formats
File formats that support NMR can be roughly devided into 4 categories:

### Multi domain data formats
These formats are capable of supporting not solely NMR technique, but many other ones as well. They include:
 <table>
  <tr>

    <th>Maintainer</th>
    <th>File extension</th>
    <th>Parent Format</th>
    <th>Specification</th>

    <td>for members</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

### NMR Vendor formats
As instrument vendors typically provide the data processing software and produce evolving data formats together with the instrument hardware, developers of third party NMR analysis software often need to devote considerable effort into reading and writing these vendor-specific formats. Data in proprietary formats can age quickly, and NMR data stored in such formats can become obsolete, making valuable results inaccessible and irreproducible in the long term. However, we will still support this data along with the open format to make sure that the original data is maintained (From [nmrML: A Community Supported Open Data Standard for the Description, Storage, and Exchange of NMR Data](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02795)).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Agilent (Varian)</td>
    <td>Bruker Formats</td>
    <td>Bruker FID</td>
    <td>Bruker JCAMP-DX</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bruker pulse</td>
    <td>GE Nicolet</td>
    <td>GE Omega</td>
    <td>Jeol FID</td>

  <tr>

    <td>Varian VNMR</td>
    <td>VARIAN/Chemagnetic Spinsight</td>
    <td> </td>
  </tr>
</table> 

### Software-specifific NMR formats
Formats generated by NMR data processing tools.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>ACD/Labs</td>
    <td>FELIX</td>
    <td>Galactic GRAMS</td>
    <td>Gaussian</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>LCModel</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Sparky, UCSF</td>
    <td>SIMPSON</td>
    <td>SwaN-MR</td>
    <td>1D WinNMR</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

### NMR open formats
Currently, the most widely used open data exchange format for NMR data is JCAMP-DX, but due to the broad scope and complexity of this format, it has become clear that alternative approaches with peer-maintained ontologies, would be beneficial. In NFDI4Chem, and in nmrXiv, we will be working on extending the available open NMR format NMReData as a possible alternative.
Here we provide a list of some available open formats (licensed with open license):
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Short name</th>
    <th>Maintainer</th>
    <th>File extension</th>
    <th>Parent Format</th>
    <th>Specification</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://nmrml.org/">nmrML</a></td>
    <td>COSMOS</td>
    <td>.nmrML</td>
    <td>XML</td>
    <td>open</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://nmredata.org/">NMReDATA</a></td>
    <td>NMReDATA Initiative</td>
    <td>.sdf</td>
    <td>SDF</td>
    <td>open</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>NMR Star</td>

We would like to thank Dr. Steffen Neumann, Mr. David Rauh, and Dr. Tilmann Fischer for their contribution to the NMR data formats.
## Overview on available open NMR file formats converters

### ChemSpectra
ChemSpectra is a software for visualizing and analyzing analytical data, integrating solutions for IR (infrared spectroscopy), mass spectrometry (MS), and one-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR (proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy data. It is provided in two versions, as a standalone version to be used as an independent service and as an integrated editor.

In order to standardize treatment of all data files uploaded to ChemSpectra as non-JCAMP-DX files, it converts them to JCAMP-DX. Those formats at the moment include mzML and fid as zip file. 

For more details on ChemSpectra, please refer to [ChemSpectra: a web-based spectra editor for analytical data](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-020-00481-0)

### NMRium

NMRium can convert open and vendor file formats to other formats. As an input, it can handle:
    Jcamp DX (.dx, .jdx, .jcamp)
    zipped folder in Bruker format (raw data or processed)
    Jeol (.jdf)
    NMRium file (.nmrium)
And as output, it gives back NMRium file (.nmrium) or NMReData.

### TAPIR
This converter is still being developed and currently it can only handle MS files, but it will be able to convert NMR files in the near future. For more details, please follow this [link](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/formaTAPIRest).
