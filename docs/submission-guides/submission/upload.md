Submitting data to [nmrXiv](https://www.nmrxiv.org) is really simple and just a 3 step process. 
Before you start submitting data you need to 
* First register and create an account in [nmrXiv](https://www.nmrxiv.org).
* Make sure your folder is structured in the format described [here](/docs/submission-guides/submission/folder-structure).
* Your folder contains files of a supported type.

Follow the steps below to successfully submit your data.

* **Files Upload**

Click on the `upload` button to open the submission process. Provide basic details about your submission such as project name, description and keywords to categorize your project. Drag and drop your folder and wait for the upload to be completed.

* **Assignement & Meta data**

In this step you can use [NMRium](https://www.nmrium.org/) to edit your spectra and assign the peaks to the corresponding chemical groups, additionally, you can provide the metadata of the studies and samples. You have a view of all the studies in the project with the datasets they include.
You can navigate through different datasets(experiments) within the study, visualize and edit the spectrum respectively. Below in the info table you will find all the information extracted by [NMRium](https://www.nmrium.org/) about the NMR experiment.

The `Sample Info` tab shows details including the chemical composition (available molecules and their percentages). In the editor below you can add the structure of your chemical composition or can also import from the SMILES.

The `Meta Data` shows an overview of the study's metadata, press on **autogenerate** to auto-generate the description of the study, or can also edit and add manually if needed.

* **Final step**

After clicking on proceed your data will be now submitted and processed in the background. Give us a few moments for the queue to get processed and you will receive an email once the processing is complete.
You will be redirected to the final page of the submission workflow where you get the overview summary of the whole project. Here you can edit the existing details and enter other essential information such as defining privacy, choosing release date, and [license](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/nmrxiv/discussions/123). There is also a quick download link to download your whole project.
Click on the `Save` button and press `Finish` and you are done!!
