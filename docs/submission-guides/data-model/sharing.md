# Sharing

**[nmrXiv](https://nmrxiv.org/)** sharing feature allows users to share projects and studies singly or in bulks within teams facilitating collaboration and review. In both cases, there are roles controlling who can do what with the shared item.

:::info Info
There are three roles for sharing:
- **Owner**: read/update/delete the project/studies/datasets.
- **Collaborator**: read/update the project/studies/datasets. A collaborator cannot delete any of the project content.
- **Viewer**: read the project/studies/datasets. A viewer cannot update or delete any of the project content.

## Single Sharing
This option is available for both projects and studies. At the top of their views, there are avatars of the users with whom the project or the study is shared as circles with either the users' images or names' first letters. Clicking on those avatars enables modifying the sharing settings by first opening a window that shows with whom the project or study is already shared along with the roles. 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src="/img/project/new-share.png" width="1000"/>
<figcaption>Project sharing status</figcaption>
</div>

Then the user can click on the button `Share`, which will open another window to share the project or study with other users.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src="/img/project/select-share.png" width="1000"/>
<figcaption>Share with users window</figcaption>
</div>

In the opened window, the user needs to fill in the email and select the role of the user to share with, and they can optionally add a message.

## Teams Sharing
Teams enable sharing bulks of projects with the same people and roles while providing the flexibility to add or remove members or change their roles. For more details on how to create teams and add members, please check [Team page](/docs/submission-guides/data-model/team.md).
