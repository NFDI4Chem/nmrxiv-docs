nmrXiv is organized around Projects. Once you have registered your account successfully in nmrXiv, the first step by which you can start is by creating Projects.
A user can create single or multiple Projects and each Projects can contain single or multiple [Studies](https://docs.nmrxiv.org/docs/submission-guides/study).

#### Create
To create your first Project click on the `New Project` button or `Create a new project` tab. 
You can choose to make your Project `Public` or `Private`. If it's Private then it is accessible(the project only, not the underlying studies) by you and the members of the team, if it's Public then everyone with the link will be able to access the project.
