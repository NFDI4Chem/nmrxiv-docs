Each Project may house a variety of Studies. Studies can be versioned, command invocations, and metrics.
A Project can contain as many Studies as you wish and each Study receives its very own URL.

#### Create
To create a new Study click on the `New Study` button or `Create new study` tab.
You can choose to make your Study `Public` or `Private`. If it's Private then it is accessible by you and the members of the team, if it's Public then everyone with the link will be able to access the Study.
