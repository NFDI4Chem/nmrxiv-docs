# NMR MIChI Workshops in NFDI4Chem 
NFDI4Chem is facilitating and organising a series of international workshops in different subdisciplines of chemistry to develop domain-specific MI standards. Each of the developed standards will be a modular recommendation for Minimum Information on Chemical Investigations due to the sheer size and variability of the field. Prior to the publication of the standards, there will be a Request for Comments (RFC) as part of a public review of the standards. Here you can find all the workshops related to NMR and analytical chemistry. For a full-list of the workshops, please visit [this link](https://nfdi4chem.github.io/workshops/).

## FAIR NMR Research Data Management
NFDI4Chem, in collaboration with IUPAC, has organized a workshop about FAIR NMR Research Data Management where experts contributing to the FAIRness and standardization of NMR data have participated in identifying challenges and finding solutions in this area. The discussions covered NMR repositories in NFDI4Chem and how to make their data more findable and interoperable, along with terminology, file formats, implementations, and validations.

## Coming Soon
### NFDI4Chem Workshop Data Formats
Discussion on available data formats in analytical chemistry, can we make any available open formats a standard? And how can they evolve to be so? 

### Minimum Information Standards in Analytical Chemistry
Work in Progress.
