**Public** projects(including the underline studies and datasets) are visible and accessible to everyone(even to the non-registered user of [nmrXiv](https://nmrxiv.org/)). You can see all the open projects [here](https://nmrxiv.org/projects) or can also find them in the Projects tab in the left-hand panel of your dashboard.

If you make your project public you are making it open for access(including the underline studies and datasets) to everyone(even to the non-registered user of [nmrXiv](https://nmrxiv.org/)), but you can define rights by choosing a license for your project.
