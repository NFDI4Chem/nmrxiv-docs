### [Staging](https://dev.nmrxiv.org)
The [Staging](https://dev.nmrxiv.org)(pre-production) is the replica of [production](https://www.nmrxiv.org/) environment and provides a scope to test all the installation/configuration/migration scripts and procedures before they're applied to a [production](https://www.nmrxiv.org/) environment. Stake Holders and all the Reviewers will have the access to [staging](https://dev.nmrxiv.org) where they can test/preview new or existing features and also can use them for demo purposes.
All the code changes, features, or any bug fixes have to pass through [staging](https://dev.nmrxiv.org) before getting released to [production](https://www.nmrxiv.org/).
Another important use of [staging](https://dev.nmrxiv.org) is performance or stress testing.

### [Production](https://www.nmrxiv.org/)
The [Production](https://www.nmrxiv.org/) environment is also known as live, particularly for servers, as it is the environment which users directly interact with. This environment refers to where the software or products have been made live for use of the intended users.
Once the code is in the [production](https://www.nmrxiv.org/), any bugs need to have already been fixed and the product or update must work perfectly.
