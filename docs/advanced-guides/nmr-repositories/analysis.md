# NMR Repositories Overview

### Organism
Humans and mice are the most studied species in both [MetaboLights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) and [Metabolomics Workbench](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/), while [CENAPT](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/cenapt) doesn't provide this information unless one checks in the corresponding articles. Other, less commonly studied, species include sheep, rats, horses, wild boars and others. [Notebook link](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/repo-scripts/blob/main/notebooks/organism.ipynb)

### Organism Part
As humans and mice are the most studied species in both [MetaboLights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) and [Metabolomics Workbench](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/), most of the cases where the organism part is reported come from them. Blood serum and plasma, liver, muscles, urine and feces are the most studied. [Notebook link](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/repo-scripts/blob/main/notebooks/organism-part.ipynb)

### Variant
The variant details were mostly missing, but when reported, they mostly come from mice and rats. [Notebook](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/repo-scripts/blob/main/notebooks/variant.ipynb)

### Ontologies
They were used only in [MetaboLights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/). The ontologies mentioned here were evaluated for possible use in nmrXiv. For more details on that, check [ontologies](https://docs.nmrxiv.org/docs/introduction/ontologies) page.

### pH
It was possible to get the pH details only from [MetaboLights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) where we see that most samples' pHs were leaning towards the neutral 7. [Notebook link](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/repo-scripts/blob/main/notebooks/ph.ipynb)

### Study Sizes
Although the study size was mostly in tens of megabytes, there were few studies with a size of tens of gigabytes. [Notebook link](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/repo-scripts/blob/main/notebooks/size.ipynb)
